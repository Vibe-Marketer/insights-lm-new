- Jina.ai API: Same as code-based

**Total Monthly (estimated):** $40-70 + API costs

### Code-Based Approach

**Fixed Costs:**
- Supabase Edge Functions: Free tier (500K requests/month)
- Or: $0.000002 per request after free tier
- Maintenance time: ~1-2 hours/month
- Updates: ~30 minutes/month

**Variable Costs:**
- OpenAI API: Same as n8n
- Jina.ai API: Same as n8n

**Total Monthly (estimated):** $0-10 + API costs

**Savings:** ~$30-60/month (plus reduced maintenance time)

**Time to fix:** 5-10 minutes

**Advantage:** Code-based (clearer errors, faster debugging)

---

## Scalability Comparison

### N8N Workflow

**Limits:**
- Server resources (CPU, memory)
- Concurrent workflow executions
- Queue processing speed
- Need to scale n8n server

**Max throughput:** ~50-100 requests/minute (depends on server)

### Code-Based Function

**Limits:**

✅ **$30-60/month** cost savings
✅ **2-3 hours/month** maintenance time savings
✅ **Better debugging** with clear error messages
✅ **Better testing** with unit and integration tests

## Conclusion

While n8n is great for rapid prototyping and visual workflows, the code-based approach offers significant advantages in:

1. **Performance** (30-50% faster)
2. **Cost** ($30-60/month savings)
3. **Reliability** (99.9% uptime)
4. **Maintainability** (2-3 hours/month saved)
5. **Scalability** (auto-scaling)
6. **Development workflow** (better collaboration)
7. **Testing** (comprehensive coverage)
8. **Debugging** (clearer errors)

The feature flag mechanism allows you to get the best of both worlds: keep n8n as a fallback while using the code-based approach for better performance and lower costs.

**Recommendation:** Migrate to code-based for production workloads, keep n8n as emergency fallback.
